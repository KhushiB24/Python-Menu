# First 15 seconds

Here is my replit and some of the challenges I faced was how to write the alogrhtim for the loops and I learned to use imports and driver to organize the files and menu. 

Next, here is are my commits on my Crossover peer's repo. 
I created the code for factorial class with Kamya, where both contributed with creating code where I had done some research to help us create our code.

For a math function, I had created a right triangle that I had implemented from my code to my peer's code as there can be different project of the Christmas tree code that we created.

Also, I made my matrix code from research as well as the code that I created in my own project for the matrix.
